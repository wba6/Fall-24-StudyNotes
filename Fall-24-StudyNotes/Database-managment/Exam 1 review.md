# Introduction to Database Systems

### Transactional data:
**Structured data** created with an organization, with sizes ranging from gigabytes to terabytes. 
Transactional data refers to structured data generated by day-to-day operations within an organization. This type of data typically involves records of transactions such as purchases, bookings, or customer interactions.

### Big data
Data generated by **multimedia applications** and internet of things.
Big data differs from transactional data in the following four ways:
- Volume: How much data at rest terabytes to exabytes
- Velocity: Data in motion / streaming data, milliseconds to seconds to respond
- Variety: Data in many forms, structured unstructed, text, multimedia 
- Veracity: Data in doubt or uncertainty due to data inconsistency  

### Examples of transactional data

The Ohio department of motor vehicles processes vehicle registrations, drivers licenses, and traffic violations for 26 million drivers. Assume each driver creates 4 transactions per year at 1000 bytes per transaction, on average, and 5 years of data are stored in a database.

**Bank Transactions**:
- A customer makes a payment or withdrawal from a bank account.
- Fields recorded might include:
    - Account Number
    - Transaction Date and Time
    - Transaction Amount
    - Transaction Type (Deposit, Withdrawal, Transfer)
    - Balance after Transaction
    
**Retail Sales**:
- When a customer buys products in a store, transactional data would include:
    - Purchase ID
    - Customer ID
    - Product ID
    - Quantity purchased
    - Price
    - Date and Time of Purchase
### Examples of big data 

Youtube users view approximately 4 million videos per minutes worldwide. Youtube tracks all views and information about video content to optimize advertising shown to each user. Assume youtube stores approximately 10,000 bytes per view annually.

**Social Media Data**
- **Description**: Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn generate vast amounts of data every second.
- **Components**:
    - **User Posts and Comments**: Text, images, videos, and other multimedia content.
    - **User Interactions**: Likes, shares, retweets, and reactions.
    - **Metadata**: Timestamps, geolocation data, and device information.
- **Use Cases**:
    - Sentiment analysis to gauge public opinion.
    - Targeted advertising based on user behavior and preferences.
    - Trend analysis to identify popular topics.
    
**Internet of Things (IoT) Data**
- **Description**: Devices connected to the internet, such as smart thermostats, wearable fitness trackers, and industrial sensors, continuously generate data.
- **Components**:
    - **Sensor Readings**: Temperature, humidity, motion, and other environmental metrics.
    - **Device Logs**: Operational data from machinery and equipment.
    - **User Interactions**: Data from smart home devices controlled by users.
- **Use Cases**:
    - Predictive maintenance in manufacturing to prevent equipment failures.
    - Smart city applications like traffic management and energy consumption optimization.
    - Health monitoring through wearable devices.

### Database systems
**Database**: A very large collection of interrelated data
Models a real-world enterprise:
- Entities/Objects
- Relationships
A **database management system** is a software system designed to store, manage, and facilitate access to databases.

### Why use databases
In the early days file systems were used but that have some drawbacks:
- Data redundancy
- Difficulty sorting and accessing data ( no api)
- Data isolation( no standard format) and lack of security 
- Integrity problems ( cannot control input data such as account > 0)
- Concurrency problems

So we use databases to solve some of those problems here are some advantages behind them:
- Data independence ( primary key / unique)
- Efficient data access
- Data integrity and security 
- Concurrent access, and crash recovery

But databases did also have some drawbacks such as:
- Expensive and complicated to maintain 
- They are not suited for special purpose tasks ( keyword search)

### Schemas 

A **schema** is the logical structure of the database
An **instance** is the actual content of the database

**Database** = collection of relationships / tables
**Relation schema** = relation name and attribute list. (Optionally data types)
**Database schema** = set of all relation relation schema in the database 

# SQL - Structured Query Language
SQL is designed for managing data held in a relational database management system. SQL consists of a **data definition language** and a **data manipulation language**.

**Two main components of SQL**:
1. Data Definition Language
	- This is for tables such as creating, altering or dropping
2. Data Manipulation Language 
	- This is for data such as insert, update, delete, and select

**Creating, Dropping, and adding a column to  a table**:
```
//Create table
CREATE TABLE <table_name> (<List of elements>);

//Delete table
DROP TABLE <table_name>;

//Add a column
ALTER TABLE <table_name> ADD <column_name> datatype;
```
